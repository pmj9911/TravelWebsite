                  <p class="card-text"> The iconic landmark of Kolkata, Howrah Bridge is a massive steel structure which is considered as one of the longest cantilever bridges of its type in the world. Also called as Rabindra Setu, it extends across the Hooghly River and connects Howrah and Kolkata. It is also regarded as one of the busiest ones among them as it carries a daily traffic of over 100,000 vehicles and countless pedestrians. For those who wish to see the grandeur of the bridge, you are recommended an excellent ride in the ferry services between Kolkata and Howrah, offered from Launch Ghat. The view of the city from the ferry, especially in the night, is priceless, to say the least. 

Howrah Bridge was the third longest cantilever bridge at the time of its construction, but now it is the sixth longest one of its types. It was renamed as Rabindra Setu on June 14, 1965, after the name of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. It spreads about 1500 ft over the Hooghly River and is 71 ft wide. There is a total of 8 lanes of strand road, bicycles, and pedestrians. What makes this bridge unique is the fact that it was built without a single nut or bolt and is held together by rivets. 

The Howrah Bridge has been shown in numerous movies since the 1950s like Do Bigha Zameen, China Town, Amar Prem, Parineeta, The Namesake, Love Aaj Kal, Barfi, Gunday and many others. You can walk across the bridge and admire the gigantic construction or glide underneath on a boat ride on the Hooghly River. Once you are here, you will question the notion yourself: who said that Kolkata is an archaic city stuck in the Stone Age?</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Another symbol of the British Raj in India, the Victoria Memorial is located in the heart of Kolkata, which was formerly known as Calcutta, in West Bengal, India. This white marbled beauty, which can rightly be called the epitome of grace and elegance, was built in memory of Queen Victoria to celebrate her 25 years of rule over India. Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India, undertook the task of putting up this magnificent monument for people to see and appreciate, and today the Victoria Memorial is counted as one of the best places to visit, not only in Kolkata but the entire country.

The intricate memorial not only bears testimony to the British rule in India but also stands out as an example of refined and excellent architecture in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style that existed in that era. Considered to the pride of Kolkata, the Victoria Memorial boasts of an assortment of paintings that date back to the British period and some other displays. The Royal Gallery houses the masterpieces of Jansen and Winter Halter, which skillfully depict the life of Prince Albert, while the Calcutta Gallery is revered for being the first city gallery of the country. The lush green and well-maintained garden, which spreads over 64 acres, has numerous statues and sculptures in it. The sixteen-foot tall bronze statue of victory, mounted on ball bearings at the top of the memorial, serves to heighten the overall appeal and grandeur of the entire complex. 

The site looks breathtaking and marvellous, especially at night, when it is illuminated. The Son-et-Lumiere shows that take place in the evening are an added delight, and a must watch for all people who choose to visit this place. All in all, the place is a must visit for people to wish to relive the essence of the Victorian era in the modern day world.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">One of the oldest markets in Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk is Old Delhi's main thoroughfare which is a chaotic shopping street lined by hawkers and porters with narrow lanes offering full medieval bazaar experience. It is an important historical site renowned for the availability of every kind of goods as well as food. It was constructed in the 17th-century b the Mughal ruler of India Shah Jahan. It is situated opposite the Red Fort and provides a view of the Fatehpuri Mosque.Crisscrossed by narrow streets with shops jostling for space, Chandi Chowk gives a feel of old Delhi shopping. Since the 17th-century era, this places is rightly called a "shoppers paradise" in Delhi. During the reign of Shah Jahan, there was a tree-lined canal running through its centre, reflecting the moon. Hence, the name "Chandni Chowk" came to being which means "moonlight place". Shopping at Chandni Chowk is fun as the market is distributed in several streets and these narrow streets are inundated with vibrant varieties of clothes, perfumes, electronic items, jewellery, candles, idols of deities and lifestyle goods. The market deals in everything that shoppers might think to buy for oneself and as well as for home. It has been aptly said for this barrage of noise, colour and smell, "Are janaab Dilli aae aur chandni chowk nahi dekha to kya dekha?"</p>

                  <p class="card-text">As the name suggests, Humayun's tomb is the final resting place of the Mughal Emperor Humayun. Located in the Nizamuddin East area of Delhi, it is the first garden tomb in the Indian subcontinent. This splendid piece of architecture was commissioned for construction by Humayun's chief consort empress Bega Begum in the year 1569-70 and is one of the very few structures that used red sandstone on such a massive scale at that time. The design of Humayun's tomb is a typical Mughal architecture with Persian influences and was conceptualised by Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyath. Owing to its magnificent design and illustrious history, Humayun's Tomb was featured in UNESCO's World Heritage List in the year 1993.

The architectural genius of Humayun's tomb is hard to miss. This magnificent tomb sits in the middle of a huge, ornate Mughal Garden and its beauty is only enhanced during the winter months. Situated on the banks of the River Yamuna, this mausoleum is also home to the remains of many other Mughals, including his wives, son and descendants of the later Emperor Shah Jahan, as well as numerous other subsequent Mughals.</p>

It was built by Maharaja Jai Singh in the year 1724 and forms a part of a collection of five such observatories located in Jaipur, Ujjain, Varanasi and Mathura. Delhi's Jantar Mantar consists of 13 architectural astronomy instruments which can be used to compile the astronomical tables and to predict the movement and timings of the sun, moon and planets. The intelligent construction and placement of these instruments allowed the observer to note the position of heavenly bodies with their naked eye alone. Jantar Mantar observatory consists of masonry built astronomical instruments that have stood the test of time and still work as well as they did in the olden days. This observatory was erected by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur upon the instructions of Muhammad Shah. Built out of brick, rubble and were then plastered with lime. The apparatus here pertains to Egypt's Ptolemaic astronomy and follows three classical celestial coordinates to track the positions of heavenly bodies. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">The Red Fort is a historical fortification in the national capital of New Delhi. Located in the center of the city, it was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal dynasty. It was constructed by Shah Jahan in the year 1939 as a result of a capital shift from Agra to Delhi. This imposing piece of architecture derives its name from its impregnable red sandstone walls. In addition to accommodating the emperors and their households, it was the ceremonial and political center of the Mughal state and the setting for events critically impacting the region. Every year, the Indian Prime Minister unfurls the national flag here on the Independence Day. 
Formerly known as Quila-e-Mubarak, it lies along the banks of the river Yamuna, whose waters fed the moats surrounding the fort. It was a part of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad, now 'Old Delhi'. The entire fort complex is said to represent the architectural creativity and brilliance of Mughal architecture. With so much history and heritage associated with it, the Red Fort is one of the most popular monuments in India and a major tourist attraction in Delhi. It became a UNESCO world heritage site in 2007. The Archaeological Survey of India is at present responsible for the security and preservation of this magnificent monument.</p>
