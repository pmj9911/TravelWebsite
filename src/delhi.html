It is situated opposite the Red Fort and provides a view of the Fatehpuri Mosque.Crisscrossed by narrow streets with shops jostling for space, Chandi Chowk gives a feel of old Delhi shopping. Since the 17th-century era, this places is rightly called a "shoppers paradise" in Delhi. During the reign of Shah Jahan, there was a tree-lined canal running through its centre, reflecting the moon. Hence, the name "Chandni Chowk" came to being which means "moonlight place". Shopping at Chandni Chowk is fun as the market is distributed in several streets and these narrow streets are inundated with vibrant varieties of clothes, perfumes, electronic items, jewellery, candles, idols of deities and lifestyle goods. The market deals in everything that shoppers might think to buy for oneself and as well as for home. It has been aptly said for this barrage of noise, colour and smell, "Are janaab Dilli aae aur chandni chowk nahi dekha to kya dekha?"</p>

Located in the Nizamuddin East area of Delhi, it is the first garden tomb in the Indian subcontinent. This splendid piece of architecture was commissioned for construction by Humayun's chief consort empress Bega Begum in the year 1569-70 and is one of the very few structures that used red sandstone on such a massive scale at that time. The design of Humayun's tomb is a typical Mughal architecture with Persian influences and was conceptualised by Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyath. Owing to its magnificent design and illustrious history, Humayun's Tomb was featured in UNESCO's World Heritage List in the year 1993.

The architectural genius of Humayun's tomb is hard to miss. This magnificent tomb sits in the middle of a huge, ornate Mughal Garden and its beauty is only enhanced during the winter months. Situated on the banks of the River Yamuna, this mausoleum is also home to the remains of many other Mughals, including his wives, son and descendants of the later Emperor Shah Jahan, as well as numerous other subsequent Mughals.</p>

It was built by Maharaja Jai Singh in the year 1724 and forms a part of a collection of five such observatories located in Jaipur, Ujjain, Varanasi and Mathura. Delhi's Jantar Mantar consists of 13 architectural astronomy instruments which can be used to compile the astronomical tables and to predict the movement and timings of the sun, moon and planets. The intelligent construction and placement of these instruments allowed the observer to note the position of heavenly bodies with their naked eye alone. Jantar Mantar observatory consists of masonry built astronomical instruments that have stood the test of time and still work as well as they did in the olden days. This observatory was erected by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur upon the instructions of Muhammad Shah. Built out of brick, rubble and were then plastered with lime. The apparatus here pertains to Egypt's Ptolemaic astronomy and follows three classical celestial coordinates to track the positions of heavenly bodies. </p>

Located in the center of the city, it was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal dynasty. It was constructed by Shah Jahan in the year 1939 as a result of a capital shift from Agra to Delhi. This imposing piece of architecture derives its name from its impregnable red sandstone walls. In addition to accommodating the emperors and their households, it was the ceremonial and political center of the Mughal state and the setting for events critically impacting the region. Every year, the Indian Prime Minister unfurls the national flag here on the Independence Day. 
Formerly known as Quila-e-Mubarak, it lies along the banks of the river Yamuna, whose waters fed the moats surrounding the fort. It was a part of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad, now 'Old Delhi'. The entire fort complex is said to represent the architectural creativity and brilliance of Mughal architecture. With so much history and heritage associated with it, the Red Fort is one of the most popular monuments in India and a major tourist attraction in Delhi. It became a UNESCO world heritage site in 2007. The Archaeological Survey of India is at present responsible for the security and preservation of this magnificent monument.</p>
